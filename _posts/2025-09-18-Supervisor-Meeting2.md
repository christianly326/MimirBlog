- Initially in the next sprint we wanted to order the parts for the physical mirror, on that list was a monitor. Dr Nie happened to have two monitors available for us to use for the project. She gave us the option to pop by her office next week and choose a monitor of our liking for the project.

- Additionally she recommended that we hold off on purchasing all the part now and to leave that for a later date when we have a solid amount of the project coded

- The official registration is open in the university for the 4th year project and she urged us to complete it asap so she can start logging our meetings in the system

- We also agreed to send her our completed draft of the Functional Specification document, the only outstanding task is to fomat the references properly
