**What went well:**

- We know what server we are going to use for cloud deployment
- Ethics form got approved this week :D
- Robin confirmed that we can implement simple token authentication


**What went wrong:**

- Commits went missing for UploadClothingItem ticket
- errors were highlighted due to missing commits
- Login token implmentation had to be implemented to validate credentials across platforms (unexpected)
- Delayed deliveries on tickets. 


**Start Doing:**

- Delivering tickets upon expected timeframe/sprint
- Create new tickets when scope expands when developing.
- Creating unit tests alongside development
- Deploying our pipelines per client

**Stop Doing:**

- Expanding the scope of tickets


**Continue Doing:**
- Developing?
