We had a discussion on our branding, which led to a pivot:

-Our initial idea was to use a forest green, inspired by Mimir (the Norse god of wisdom often associated with a tree). However, upon creating initial mockups, we felt the colour was too earthy and not suitable for a modern fashion application. After testing several palettes, we collectively decided to pivot to a more calming baby blue scheme, which feels more aligned with a clothing aesthetic.

-We also finalized a logo using a Nordic-style 'M', which will provide a strong, recognisable brand identity for both the mirror UI and the companion app.
