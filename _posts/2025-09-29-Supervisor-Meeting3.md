Group had a Functional Specification Review talk with supervisor. 
Notes:

The area focused in the review was the functionality of our companion App and AI models. 

It was discussed that we should consider the usability of uploading items to the user. -> Is there a faster way to upload clothing items other than one by one?

We also considered the capabilities of our AI models, Test and Demonstrate how the AI model fits into our needs.

It was originally discussed to have ChatGPT 5 Model to handle all AI capable needs. However, it was made clear in the meeting that exploring new AI models especially with our satic overlay of clothes would be beneficial

_side note_: Robin has stated that her past students had made efforts in achieving student awards within their project. Reflecting on this knowdledge has given the group a new perspective on how we should handle the fourth year project ðŸ˜“.
