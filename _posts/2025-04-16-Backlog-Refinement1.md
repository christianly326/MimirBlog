We continued working through our Sprint 2 tasks today and help a backlog refinement of Jira tasks.

We added several new tickets for ideas and features we might want to explore in the future (e.g., social features, advanced AI recommendations ect). These were tagged with "fluff" to indicate they are low priority and may not make it into the final product.

We also dedicated time to knowledge sharing. Christian walked Diana through the Magic Mirror setup process, and Diana explained the Android environment configuration. This ensures we are on the same page and can assist each other if needed, promoting true collaboration.
