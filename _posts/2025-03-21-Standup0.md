With our project idea solidified, today's meeting focused on the logistics and initial planning. We expanded on the "how" of the Mimir smart mirror.

We discussed the core components we'll need: both hardware (the two-way mirror, display, camera, Raspberry Pi/microcomputer) and software (the Magic Mirror framework, mobile companion app, computer vision libraries, and a potential backend).

Our research confirmed that the concept is not only plausible but also a technical challenge. We created our initial project backlog in Jira. This first draft of tasks includes:
<!--more-->

- Drafting the formal project proposal.

- Outlining the sections for a detailed Functional Specification document.

- Researching core libraries and frameworks for the mirror UI and augmented reality features.
<!--more-->

Creating this backlog makes the project feel tangible and gives us a clear path forward.
