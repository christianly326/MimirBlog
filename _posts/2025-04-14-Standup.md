We completed the final review of our project proposal! Now that the proposal is complete, we reached out via email to Dr. Dongyun (Robin) Nie, a professor whose expertise aligns perfectly with our project, to ask if she would be interested in being our supervisor for the 2025/2026 academic year.

With the proposal phase concluded, we officially closed Sprint 1 and initiated Sprint 2. Our focus now shifts from planning to initial technical setup and exploration.
