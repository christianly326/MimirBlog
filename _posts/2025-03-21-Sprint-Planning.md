Today's meeting focused on the logistics and initial planning. We explored the "how" of the Mimir smart mirror.

We discussed the core components we'll need: both hardware (the two-way mirror, display, camera, Raspberry Pi/microcomputer) and software (the Magic Mirror framework, mobile companion app, computer vision libraries, and a backend).

Our research confirmed that the concept is not only plausible but also a technical challenge. To translate our vision into actionable work, we created our initial project backlog in Jira. This first draft of tasks includes:

-Drafting the formal project proposal.

-Outlining the sections for a detailed Functional Specification document.

-Researching core libraries and frameworks for the mirror UI and the possiblity of augmented reality features.

Creating this backlog makes the project feel tangible and gives us a clear path forward for the coming weeks.
