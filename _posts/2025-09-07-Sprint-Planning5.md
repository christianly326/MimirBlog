The break is over and we are now resuming work on Mimir Project. We held a meeting to assess our progress on the Functional Specification document.
<!--more-->

We identified the remaining sections, which we had previously marked to be done together (coloured green in our doc), and created tickets for each:
<!--more-->

- Assigned to Diana: Functional Requirements, Communication Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram.

- Assigned to Christian: Component Diagram, Data Flow Diagram, Scalability & Future Goals, Terms & Acronyms.

This distribution felt even and plays to our respective strengths. Furthermore, we created two critical tickets to improve our project documentation:
<!--more-->

- Christian will use Vercel to set up a proper blog site to host our project updates.

- Diana will use all our meeting notes and records to compose detailed, well-written blog entries (like this one!) to be posted on the new site.
