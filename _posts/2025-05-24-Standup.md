Today's meeting involved dicsussing prespective features involving digital try on and the non-functional requirements.

-After evaluating the complexity of real-time body tracking, we decided to implement a static avatar system for the digital try-on feature. The user will upload a photo of themselves, which will be used as the base for overlaying clothing items. This approach simplifies the initial implementation significantly while still delivering the core value proposition of visualizing outfits. The use case diagrams were updated to reflect this change in functionality.

-Diana reviewed the non-functional requirements. The outcome was to commit to an Android-first approach for the mobile companion app. To avoid scope creep and clarify our goals, all mentions of iOS were removed from the functional specification. This focus will allow us to build a more polished product for a single platform.
