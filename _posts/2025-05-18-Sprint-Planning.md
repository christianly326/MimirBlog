We planned and started Sprint 4 today, our focus has shifted from broad design to technical architecture. We had a discussion about the use cases.

Initially, we had one large diagram, but it became clear that it was too complex. We decided to split it into two separate diagrams:

-One for the Mirror Interface

-One for the Companion Mobile App

This separation significantly clarifies the user interactions and system responsibilities for each component, making the architecture much easier to understand and document.
