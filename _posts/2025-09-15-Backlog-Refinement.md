With the Functional Specification nearly complete, we held a backlog refinement session to ensure our task list is clean, actionable, and aligned with our goals.

Diana initiated the meeting by presenting a list of new tickets that represent the next phase of our project: the transition from planning to active development and official university processes.


-We reviewed the backlog and decided to remove all tickets previously tagged as "fluff." These were early, aspirational ideas that, while nice, were cluttering our board and distracting from our main focus. This cleanup has made our backlog much more manageable and goal-oriented.

We created a suite of new tickets to capture the critical work ahead:

-Drafting and submitting the required ethical approval form for our project.

-Researching and implementing connections for the Weather and Calendar APIs.

-Designing and documenting the initial database schema for user clothing items and outfits.

-Converting our Proposal and Functional Specification documents from Google Docs to well-formatted Markdown for our GitLab repository.

-Dedicating time to research specific AI/ML models suitable for our outfit recommendation engine.

-Migrating from our temporary GitHub repo to an official GitLab repository and ensuring the team is formally registered with Dr. Robin Nie as our supervisor on the university system.
