We had a short but meeting today to resolve a small but confusing ambiguity. During a review of the project timeline, we noticed a inconsistency in the date format, with some dates written in the US style (MM/DD/YYYY) and others in the European style (DD/MM/YYYY).

To prevent any future confusion regarding deadlines and milestones, we decided to standardize on the European date format (DD/MM/YYYY) across all project documentation. This is a small example of the attention to detail we're applying to ensure clarity and consistency in all our work.
