The break is over and we are now resuming work on Mimir Project. We held a meeting to assess our progress on the Functional Specification document.

We identified the remaining sections, which we had previously marked to be done together (coloured green in our doc), and created tickets for each:

-Assigned to Diana: Functional Requirements, Communication Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram.

-Assigned to Christian: Component Diagram, Data Flow Diagram, Scalability & Future Goals, Terms & Acronyms.

This distribution felt even and plays to our respective strengths. Furthermore, we created two critical tickets to improve our project documentation:

-Christian will use Vercel to set up a proper blog site to host our project updates.

-Diana will use all our meeting notes and records to compose detailed, well-written blog entries (like this one!) to be posted on the new site.
