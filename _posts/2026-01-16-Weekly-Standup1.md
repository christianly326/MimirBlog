This is our first official meeting of the new semester and the beginning of Sprint 9. Tickets were added to the jira board: 
- Companion App - upload clothes
- Companion App - creating actual wardrobe
- Companion App - home page
- Creating the pipelines
- Ai Prompt tests
- Ai Clothing Gen tests
- Build the Physical Mirror
- Login system for user
  
Also over the break we ordered all the components for the smart mirror and everything arrived safely and the mirror was contructed over the break. All the pieces have been oprganised to fit together but the mirror hasnt been screwed and glued into place yet due to us still needing to access and use the raspberry pi and camera modules.
