Sprint 1 started today. Our primary goal for this sprint is to produce a comprehensive and convincing project proposal.
<!--more-->
We began by splitting the proposal document into two main sections to divide the work efficiently:

- **Section A (Assigned to Diana):** Project description, programming languages, programming tools, competitor analysis, and a comparison of how Mimir will differentiate itself in the market.

- **Section B (Assigned to Christian):** Division of work, learning outcomes, anticipated challenges, frameworks, hardware/software platforms, and special requirements.

We also will both be contributing to the references section.

Additionally, we addressed identifying the specific hardware components we need to purchase to build the physical mirror prototype, moving us from pure software planning into the physical realm.
