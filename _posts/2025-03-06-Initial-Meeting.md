We met up to discuss and  brainstorming potential 4th year project ideas, we converged on the concept of a smart wardrobe mirror. The initial concept for Mimir is a mirror that does more than just reflect; it will help users plan their outfits, visualize clothing items digitally, and integrate with their calendar and weather forecasts to suggest appropriate attire.

Before committing, we conducted preliminary research to gauge the feasibility of the idea. The initial signs are promising, and we believe there's a genuine market for a product that simplifies the daily routine of choosing an outfit.
