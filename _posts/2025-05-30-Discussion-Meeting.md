With the core Functional Specification progressing, we held a strategic discussion meeting today. The goal was to brainstorm every possible feature we could imagine for Mimir, without any constraints, and document them in a Considerations & Future Ideas document.

Our ideas ranged from practical enhancements to forward-looking concepts:

-Features like weekly outfit planning, mood-based suggestions, and an AI that learns style preferences and provides feedback on underused items.

-Ideas for virtual background previews and more advanced 3D garment fitting using body scan data.

-"Laundry Mode," clothing condition tracking, and seasonal storage filters.

-Online shopping integration and social features for sharing outfits with friends for feedback.

-Gesture control, UI personalization, and fashion challenges to engage users.

We came to the conclusion from our discussion: "Some people are bad stylists." This observation solidified our core value proposition. Mimir isn't just for fashion enthusiasts; it's for anyone who wants to look their best with minimal effort. We also discussed the angle of helping users "keep up with the latest fashion" through our assistant and the potential to "connect e-commerce back to your home."

This meeting was crucial for capturing all the future possiblities of Mimir, ensuring we have a rich backlog of ideas while also reinforcing the focus needed to deliver the necessary features first.
