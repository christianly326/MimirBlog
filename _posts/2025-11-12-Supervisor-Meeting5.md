This meeting was centered around going through our functional specification document. Dr. Nie had a lot of revisions for our document as well as some queries that were clarified throughout the meeting

- Add page numbers to each page.
- Create a separate page for the Table of Contents. 
- Too many tables and images are included, but their meaning is unclear. Each table/image must have a proper title and number. In your explanation/discussion sections, make sure you explicitly refer to the corresponding table or image by its number.Add explanations to all diagrams (deployment 1&2 and class diagrams done)
- Add figure titles to each diagram and table
- When comparing your system with competitor products, consider using a comparison table with tick boxes. This format may present advantages and disadvantages much more clearly.(We dont mention competitors in the func spec at all??)
- Edit system product diagram to add Open ai, add in mediapipe and open ai explanation in section 5, + edit section
- Edit deployment diagrams to get rid of google cloud storage
- Explanation of timeline
- Fix the timeline
- Link all diagrams to full image file
- Make sure all references actually link to the websites ([1] links to the website)
- Make links to certain areas of the document if its relevant or is explained in another area
- Edit the timeline to change format and add more details
- Get rid of all reference links in the headlines
- Change the order and flow of information in the document
- Move the product function diagram to product function section
- Reduce the number of subsections
