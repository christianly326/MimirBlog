**Attendees:** Diana Williams Oshun, Christian Michael Lagura Yacapin

The group refined a few tickets that were added in the backlog:

- Companion App UI navigation
- Mirror interface App UI navigation
- Weather widget Mirror UI
- Companion App Home page
- Companion App Login page
- Django Backend User model

<!--more-->

**Conclusion Notes**

Queries revolved around the login page on whether we should add Two factor authentication rose.
Group came to a conclusion that we should which ended up expanding the work for the Bakend User Model and the App Login page.

The Group discussed that the research for pipelines and CI/CD needed to be carried out this sprint as a lot of these tickets would be easier to carry out if we implement a CI/CD integration early on in the development.

Diana Williams Oshun has agreed to take on the research for 1 story point.

Unexpected "Risk assessment" has been found on the proposal doc, re-adjustment of story point estimation (1->2) on MT-52
