From the current tickets in the sprint some adjustments had to be made:
- For the login system ticket there was actually additonal work and considerations like (Serialisers, Rest API, Login Frontend Page) and as such the story point estimation changed from a 2 to a 3
- Additionally we found some redundant tickets in the backlog (finding trained fashion ai, creating wardrobe models), these have been deleted since

Some updates were given on current progress as well during the meeting:
- Diana completed the Ai prompt tests and out of the three AIs tested (GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5) the results were close between GPT and Claude but in the end Claude has been chosen as our disired ai due to the results - more info on exact test results can be found in the test document
- Christian is continuing development smoothly with the login and wardrobe systems
