Today's meeting was a review of our research findings on Docker and CI/CD. We compared notes to ensure we both have a solid, shared understanding of the technologies that will be using in our development workflow. This foundational knowledge is key to building this project.

We also received a positive response from Dr. Robin Nie. We discussed her available times and officially scheduled our first project meeting with her over Zoom for April 29th.
