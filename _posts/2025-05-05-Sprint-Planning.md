We we planned and started Sprint 3 today, with our primary goal being to draft the comprehensive Functional Specification document. Diana started by creating an empty template to visualize the full scope of work required.

We divided the sections to ensure a balanced workload:

-Diana's Sections: Introduction, Product and System Functions, Step-by-Step Scenarios, User Characteristics, and Mirror View Mockups and Timeline.

-Christian's Sections: Companion App Mockups, Constraints, Use Cases, Software System Attributes, and Product Management Tools.

We also created a ticket for Diana to immediately action Dr. Nie's feedback by updating the competitor analysis.
