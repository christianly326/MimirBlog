With the tasks from Sprint 1 in review we now started planning Sprint 2. We outlined a set of tickets focused on technical discovery and environment setup:
<!--more-->
Christian will handle setting up the GitHub repository with branch protection rules and CI/CD workflows and get the basic Magic Mirror software running on a development machine.
<!--more-->
Diana will set up the Android SDK environment for the companion mobile app development. To balance the story points for the sprint, Diana will also research the feasibility of integrating an Augmented Reality (AR) feature, allowing users to "try on" clothes digitally through the mirror.
<!--more-->
Both team members have tickets to research and document their understanding of Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines, which are crucial for maintaining a consistent and automated development environment.
