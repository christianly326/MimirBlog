We held a retrospective for Sprint 5 to reflect on our process and identify areas for improvement.

**Start Doing:**
<!--more-->

- Being more honest about availability. We need to communicate our schedules with more transparently to set realistic expectations and avoid last-minute rushes.

**Stop Doing:**
<!--more-->

- Assigning too heavy a workload all at once. We recognized that front-loading a sprint with large tasks leads to pressure and potential burnout. We need to break down work into more manageable, incremental pieces.

**Continue Doing:**
<!--more-->

- Discussing tasks before commencement. Our practice of talking through tickets, clarifying requirements, and brainstorming solutions together before starting work is highly effective and should continue.


- Maintaining open communication. The constant, small improvements and discussions we have about our work are keeping the project on track and of high quality.
